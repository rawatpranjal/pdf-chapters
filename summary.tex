    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{11 Observational Causal Studies}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter addresses the challenge of establishing causality in scenarios where controlled experiments are not feasible. This includes situations where the causal action is not under the control of the organization, there are too few units for a statistically significant study, or ethical and logistical constraints prevent randomized trials.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
Consider the scenario where a company wants to understand the impact on product engagement when users switch from an iPhone to a Samsung phone. This is a typical example where the causal action (phone switching) is not directly under the control of the company, and thus a randomized controlled trial is not possible. The chapter uses this example to explore methods of observational causal inference.

\subsubsection*{Solutions and Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interrupted Time Series (ITS)}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Uses multiple pre- and post-intervention measurements to estimate the counterfactual.
        \item Example: Estimating the effect of police helicopter surveillance on home burglaries by implementing and withdrawing surveillance repeatedly.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Interleaved Experiments}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Used for comparing two ranking algorithms by interspersing their results.
        \item Limitation: Results must be homogeneous; complexities arise if the first result affects subsequent ones.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Applicable when there is a clear threshold defining treatment and control groups.
        \item Example: Assessing scholarship impacts by comparing students just above and below the grade threshold.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Instrumental Variables (IV)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Seeks to approximate random assignment using a naturally occurring instrument.
        \item Example: Using the Vietnam War draft lottery as an instrument to study the impact of military service on earnings.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Propensity Score Matching (PSM)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Matches units on a propensity score to control for confounding variables.
        \item Concern: Only accounts for observed variables, potentially missing hidden biases.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Difference in Differences (DID)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compares the pre- and post-treatment changes between a treatment group and a control group.
        \item Example: Studying the impact of TV ads on user engagement by comparing different geographical areas.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{12 Client Side Experiments}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter addresses the complexities and challenges of conducting experiments on thick clients (e.g., native mobile apps, desktop client apps) compared to thin clients (e.g., web browsers). It focuses on the differences in release processes, data communication, and user behavior, which are crucial for designing trustworthy experiments in these environments.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
Consider a scenario where a mobile app developer wants to test a new feature in their application. Unlike web-based applications where updates can be pushed and tested continuously, mobile apps require updates to be pushed through app stores and then downloaded by users. This process can delay the deployment of new features and complicate the execution of controlled experiments. For instance, if a developer wants to test two different user interfaces, they must ensure that both versions are included in the same app release due to the inability to update the app frequently.

\subsubsection*{Solutions and Implications}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Anticipate Changes Early and Parameterize:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Include all potential experimental variants in the app from the outset using feature flags.
        \item Utilize server-side configurations to manage feature rollouts and A/B tests without frequent client updates.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Expect a Delayed Logging and Effective Starting Time:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Prepare for delays in data reporting due to offline usage or limited connectivity.
        \item Consider the impact of delayed experiment start times on data collection and analysis.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Create a Failsafe for Offline or Startup Cases:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement default settings for experiments to handle cases where the device is offline at the start of an app session.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Triggered Analysis May Need Client-Side Experiment Assignment Tracking:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ensure that experiment-related data is only sent when the feature is actually used to avoid unnecessary data transmission and potential performance issues.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Track Important Guardrails on Device and App Level Health:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Monitor device-level impacts such as battery usage and app performance to avoid negative user experiences that could skew experiment results.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Monitor Overall App Release through Quasi-experimental Methods:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use the natural variation in app version adoption to conduct quasi-experiments, adjusting for biases in adoption rates.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Watch Out for Multiple Devices/Platforms and Interactions between Them:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Account for interactions between different platforms (e.g., mobile app vs. mobile web) that might affect user behavior and experiment outcomes.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{13 Instrumentation}
\subsubsection*{Introduction}
Instrumentation is essential for monitoring and understanding user interactions and system performance in any digital environment, such as websites and applications. It involves tracking user activities like clicks and hovers, and system metrics like response times and error rates. This chapter emphasizes the importance of implementing robust instrumentation to gather data that supports effective decision-making and system optimization.

\subsubsection*{Client-Side vs. Server-Side Instrumentation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Client-Side Instrumentation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Focuses on user experience: tracks user actions (clicks, hovers, scrolls), performance metrics (page load times), and errors (JavaScript errors).
        \item Drawbacks include potential negative impacts on user experience due to increased load times and resource usage, and data loss issues with web beacons.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Server-Side Instrumentation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Focuses on system operations: measures server response times, system throughput, and logs system errors.
        \item Provides more reliable and granular data about system performance, though it offers less insight into user behavior.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Processing Logs from Multiple Sources}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Logs must be integrated from various sources (client types, servers) to provide a comprehensive view of system and user activity.
    \item Essential to use a common identifier (join key) across logs to correlate events and user actions.
    \item Implementing a shared format for logs facilitates easier downstream processing and analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Culture of Instrumentation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Instrumentation should be integral to the development process; akin to ensuring all instruments in an airplane are functional before flight.
    \item Establish norms: no feature ships without proper instrumentation. Treat broken instrumentation with the same urgency as a broken feature.
    \item Regular monitoring and quality checks of instrumentation data are crucial to maintain its reliability and usefulness.
\end{itemize}

\section*{14 Choosing A Randomization Unit}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter addresses the critical issue of selecting an appropriate randomization unit in experimental design, which significantly impacts both user experience and the effectiveness of metric evaluation in experiments.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
The chapter references the historical example of the RAND Corporation's efforts in 1947 to generate a table of a million random digits. Initial production showed significant biases, necessitating multiple circuit refinements to produce satisfactory random numbers. This example underscores the importance of meticulous randomization unit selection to ensure unbiased, reliable experimental outcomes.

\subsubsection*{Solutions and Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Granularity Choices:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Page-level:} Each page view is a unit. Not suitable if user experience consistency is critical or if features span multiple pages.
        \item \textit{Session-level:} Group of pages viewed in a single visit. May lead to inconsistent user experiences if the treatment varies within the session.
        \item \textit{User-level:} All user interactions are considered a single unit. Provides consistency but may over or undercount actual users due to multiple or shared accounts.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Consistency vs. Metric Impact:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More granular randomization (e.g., page-level) increases the number of units, enhancing statistical power but potentially compromising user experience consistency.
        \item Coarser randomization (e.g., user-level) ensures user experience consistency but may reduce the sensitivity to detect minor changes.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Interference and SUTVA Considerations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ensure that the treatment of one unit does not influence another, adhering to the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA).
        \item Consider potential user behavior changes if they notice variability in their experience.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Randomization and Analysis Alignment:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The randomization unit should ideally be the same as or coarser than the analysis unit to simplify variance computation and ensure independence assumptions hold.
        \item Misalignment might require complex statistical methods like bootstrap or delta method for accurate analysis.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Special Cases and Enterprise Considerations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In environments like advertising or social networks, consider randomizing by clusters (e.g., advertisers in the same auction, clusters of friends) to minimize interference.
        \item For long-term effects or cross-platform consistency, use stable identifiers like signed-in user IDs or device IDs.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{15 Ramping Experiment Exposure}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter addresses the challenge of controlling unknown risks associated with new feature launches through a ramping process. This involves gradually increasing traffic to new treatments to balance speed, quality, and risk effectively.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
A notable example discussed is the initial launch of Healthcare.gov, which faced significant issues by rolling out to 100\% of users immediately. This led to system collapse due to unanticipated load, illustrating the critical need for a controlled ramping process to mitigate such risks.

\subsubsection*{Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pre-MPR (Minimum Power Ramp)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initiate with small, controlled traffic increases to contain impact and mitigate potential risks.
        \item Employ "rings" of testing populations for gradual exposure, starting from internal teams to beta users.
        \item Utilize real-time metrics to quickly assess and respond to any arising issues.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{MPR (Maximum Power Ramp)}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Focus on precise measurement of the treatment's impact, maintaining the experiment at MPR typically for a week to account for time-dependent factors and reduce variance.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Post-MPR}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Incremental traffic increases post-MPR to address operational concerns and ensure infrastructure can handle higher loads.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Long-Term Holdout or Replication}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conduct long-term holdouts selectively to assess sustainable impacts or when significant discrepancies between short-term and potential long-term effects are anticipated.
        \item Replicate experiments to confirm surprising results and reduce biases from multiple testing.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{16 Scaling Experiment Analyses}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter addresses the challenge of scaling data analysis pipelines within experimentation platforms to ensure methodological solidity, consistency, scientific foundation, and trustworthiness in implementation.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
As companies progress through the experimentation maturity phases to "Run" or "Fly", the integration of robust data analysis pipelines becomes crucial. This integration prevents the need for time-consuming ad hoc analyses and supports systematic, reliable decision-making processes. For instance, a company like Google processes terabytes of experiment data daily, necessitating efficient and scalable data handling and analysis methods to maintain innovation speed and accuracy.

\subsubsection*{Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Processing Steps:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Sorting and Grouping:} Data from multiple logs are sorted and joined by user ID and timestamp to create sessions and group activities within specified time windows.
        \item \textit{Cleaning:} Sessions are cleaned using heuristics to remove non-real user activities and fix instrumentation issues like duplicate events or incorrect timestamps.
        \item \textit{Enrichment:} Data is enriched by adding dimensions such as browser type or calculating metrics like session duration, which are crucial for detailed experiment analysis.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Data Computation Approaches:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Materialized Per-User Statistics:} This approach involves computing and storing user-level statistics which can be used for both business reporting and specific experiments.
        \item \textit{Integrated Computation:} Metrics needed for experiments are computed on-the-fly, tailored to specific experimental needs, ensuring resource efficiency and consistency across different data pipelines.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Results Summary and Visualization:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Key metrics and segments are visually summarized to guide decision-makers, highlighting statistically significant changes and providing drill-down capabilities for detailed segment analysis.
        \item Visualization tools are designed to be accessible to a wide range of technical backgrounds, enhancing understanding and decision-making across the organization.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Standardization and Change Management:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A common set of metrics and definitions is maintained to ensure consistency and facilitate clear communication across teams.
        \item Change management processes are established to handle updates in metrics and definitions effectively, considering historical data consistency.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{17 Statistics Behind Online Controlled Experiments}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter delves into the statistical intricacies of online controlled experiments, focusing on hypothesis testing, statistical power, and the assumptions underlying the two-sample t-test.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
Consider an online platform testing a new feature aimed at increasing user engagement. The platform uses a two-sample t-test to determine if the observed increase in engagement for users exposed to the new feature (treatment group) compared to those who were not (control group) is statistically significant. This example illustrates the practical application of statistical tests in assessing the efficacy of new features in real-world settings.

\subsubsection*{Detailed Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Two-Sample t-Test}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Assumes independence between treatment and control group metrics.
        \item Utilizes the t-statistic to normalize the difference in means, facilitating the comparison against a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{p-Value and Confidence Interval}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item p-Value calculation helps determine the extremeness of the t-statistic under the null hypothesis, guiding the decision to reject or accept the null hypothesis.
        \item Confidence intervals provide a range within which the true mean difference likely falls, offering an intuitive understanding of statistical significance.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Normality Assumption}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Relies on the Central Limit Theorem to justify normality in the distribution of sample means, especially for large sample sizes.
        \item Skewness adjustments and transformations are recommended for metrics with high skewness to meet normality assumptions.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Type I/II Errors and Power}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Balances the risk of Type I errors (false positives) and Type II errors (false negatives) through the selection of appropriate significance levels.
        \item Power analysis is crucial to determine the necessary sample size to detect a meaningful effect with high probability.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Bias and Multiple Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Discusses sources of bias and strategies for bias mitigation in experimental design.
        \item Addresses the multiple testing problem using corrections like Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg to control the family-wise error rate.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Fisher's Meta-analysis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Combines p-values from multiple independent tests to increase the overall power and reduce the probability of false positives.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{18 Variance Estimation And Improved Sensitivity}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter addresses the critical issue of variance estimation in statistical analysis, which is fundamental for computing p-values and confidence intervals. Incorrect estimation can lead to false conclusions in hypothesis testing, affecting both the scientific integrity and practical outcomes of experiments.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
Consider an online platform conducting an A/B test to compare two versions of a webpage. The key metric is the click-through rate (CTR), a ratio of clicks to page views. If the variance of this ratio is not estimated correctly, the experiment might conclude that one version is superior to the other when, in fact, the observed difference is due to random fluctuations. This can lead to poor business decisions, such as adopting a less effective webpage design.

\subsubsection*{Common Pitfalls and Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Delta vs. Delta \%}: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Incorrectly estimating the variance of percentage changes (Delta \%) by not accounting for the variability of the denominator can lead to significant errors.
        \item Correct approach: Use the formula \$ \text{var}(\Delta\%) = \frac{\text{var}(Y\_t)}{Y\_c\^2} + \frac{Y\_t\^2 \text{var}(Y\_c)}{Y\_c\^4} \$.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Ratio Metrics When Analysis Unit Differs from Experiment Unit}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Problem: Using simple variance formulas without considering the correlation between units within the same user leads to biased variance estimates.
        \item Solution: Apply the delta method for ratio metrics, ensuring that the numerator and denominator are treated as jointly bivariate normal.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Outliers}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Outliers can disproportionately inflate variance estimates, leading to less reliable statistical tests.
        \item Practical method: Cap extreme values at a reasonable threshold to mitigate the impact of outliers on variance estimation.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Improving Sensitivity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use metrics with inherently lower variance or transform metrics (e.g., log transformation) to reduce variability.
    \item Employ statistical techniques such as stratification, control variates, or CUPED to minimize variance.
    \item Consider more granular randomization units or paired experimental designs to reduce variability and improve the sensitivity of tests.
    \item Pool control groups across multiple experiments to increase the power of statistical tests.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Variance of Other Statistics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For non-average statistics like quantiles, especially in time-based metrics, use density estimation and the delta method to estimate variance accurately.
    \item Address the challenge of different levels of randomization (e.g., user-level randomization with page-level metrics) through appropriate statistical methods.
\end{itemize}

\section*{19 The Aa Test}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter delves into the significance and methodology of A/A tests in the context of controlled experiments, particularly highlighting their role in validating the reliability of an experimentation platform.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
A/A tests are crucial when a company like Bing continuously runs these tests to identify carry-over effects from previous experiments. This ensures that no residual biases affect new experiments, maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the experimental outcomes.

\subsubsection*{Solutions and Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose of A/A Tests:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Control Type I errors to expected levels (e.g., 5\%).
        \item Assess and understand metric variability over time.
        \item Check for biases between Treatment and Control groups.
        \item Validate data against system records to ensure consistency.
        \item Estimate variances for statistical power calculations in future A/B tests.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Implementation Guidelines:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Run continuous A/A tests alongside other experiments to quickly identify and rectify distribution mismatches or platform anomalies.
        \item Simulate multiple A/A tests (e.g., a thousand) to check the uniformity of p-value distributions, which indicates correct functioning.
        \item Use statistical methods like the delta method or bootstrapping to correct for any discovered biases in variance calculations.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Common Issues Identified by A/A Tests:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Incorrect variance calculations due to independence assumption violations.
        \item Biases introduced by reusing populations from prior experiments.
        \item Misalignment between the analysis unit and the randomization unit, leading to skewed p-value distributions.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Special Considerations:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Address performance issues like redirects that can affect user experience and skew results.
        \item Manage unequal experimental splits to avoid benefits to larger variants due to shared resources.
        \item Hardware discrepancies that might not be apparent but can influence the outcomes of an A/A test.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{20 Triggering For Improved Sensitivity}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter addresses the challenge of improving statistical power in experiments by effectively identifying and analyzing only those users who are impacted by the experimental changes, thereby filtering out noise from unimpacted users.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
Consider an e-commerce site testing a new checkout process. Traditionally, all users would be analyzed, but many may not even reach the checkout, rendering their data irrelevant for this change. By triggering only users who start the checkout process, the analysis becomes more focused, enhancing the sensitivity and relevance of the experimental results.

\subsubsection*{Detailed Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Intentional Partial Exposure:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analyze only users directly impacted by the change (e.g., only US users if the change is US-specific).
        \item Include activities of mixed users if they could have seen the change.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Conditional Exposure:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trigger users based on specific actions (e.g., starting checkout or using a new feature).
        \item Example: Only trigger users who use a new co-editing feature in a document editing tool.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Coverage Increase:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Trigger users who meet new criteria introduced by the experiment (e.g., cart value between \$25 and \$35 for a free shipping offer).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Coverage Change:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Adjust triggering based on both control and treatment conditions to ensure only relevant differences are analyzed.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Counterfactual Triggering for Machine Learning Models:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement dual model logging to capture differences in output that trigger user inclusion in the analysis.
        \item Consider computational and latency costs due to running multiple models.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Optimal and Conservative Triggering:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Optimal: Trigger only users with differences in treatment conditions.
        \item Conservative: Include more users to ensure no impactful user is missed, at the cost of reduced statistical power.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Overall Treatment Effect}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate the diluted impact of the treatment on the overall user base, not just the triggered users.
    \item Use refined formulas to avoid common pitfalls like overestimating the impact due to non-representative triggered samples.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Trustworthy Triggering}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perform checks like Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) and complement analysis to validate the triggering process.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Common Pitfalls}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Avoid focusing solely on tiny user segments unless the insights can be generalized.
    \item Ensure triggered users are included in the analysis for the duration of their interaction post-trigger event to capture all relevant effects.
    \item Be aware of performance impacts due to counterfactual logging, especially in controlled experiments.
\end{itemize}

\section*{21 Sample Ratio Mismatch And Other Trust Related Issues}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
This chapter addresses the issue of Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) and its impact on the trustworthiness of experimental results in statistical and machine learning contexts. SRM occurs when the observed ratio of units (e.g., users) in different experimental groups deviates significantly from the expected ratio, potentially invalidating the experiment's outcomes.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
In a controlled experiment designed to equally split users between a Control and a Treatment group, an unexpected SRM was observed. The Control group had 821,588 users while the Treatment group had 815,482 users, resulting in a ratio of 0.993 instead of the expected 1.0. The p-value of this ratio was extremely low (1.8E-6), suggesting a significant deviation from the expected distribution and indicating potential issues in the experiment's implementation, such as a bug.

\subsubsection*{Solutions and Debugging Strategies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Check Randomization and Assignment Processes:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ensure that the randomization process upstream of the experiment is unbiased and that the assignment to variants is correctly implemented.
        \item Investigate any potential interference from concurrent experiments or shared controls that might skew the distribution.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Analyze Data Pipeline Integrity:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Examine each stage of the data processing pipeline for errors that could cause SRM, such as improper bot filtering or issues in data collection and handling.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Segment Analysis:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Perform segmented analysis to identify if specific subgroups (e.g., by browser type, user demographics) are disproportionately affected.
        \item Check daily metrics to pinpoint any temporal anomalies that could contribute to SRM.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Cross-Experiment Interactions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Review interactions with other ongoing experiments to ensure they are not influencing the treatment integrity.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Re-evaluate Trigger Conditions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Confirm that the conditions triggering the inclusion of a user in the experiment are not influenced by the treatment itself, which could lead to biased results.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Post-Experiment Adjustments:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If an SRM is detected and understood, adjust the analysis or potentially rerun the experiment after addressing the identified issues.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{22 Leakage And Interference Between Variants}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
This chapter addresses the issue of interference and leakage between variants in controlled experiments, particularly when the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) does not hold. SUTVA assumes that the behavior of each unit in the experiment is unaffected by variant assignment to other units, which is not always the case in practical scenarios.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
Consider a scenario on a social network like Facebook or LinkedIn, where user behavior is influenced by their social connections. If a user finds a new feature beneficial because many of their connections are using it, they are more likely to adopt it too. This interconnected behavior can lead to spillover effects in A/B testing, where the treatment given to one user affects the behavior of another user who might be in the control group. This results in biased estimates of the treatment effect, as the behavior of the control group is inadvertently influenced by the treatment group.

\subsubsection*{Detailed Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rule-of-Thumb: Ecosystem Value of an Action}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identify actions with potential spillover effects and measure their ecosystem impact.
        \item Use historical data to establish a baseline for the impact of these actions, applying the Instrumental Variable approach for extrapolation.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Isolation Techniques}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Splitting Shared Resources:} Allocate shared resources like ad budgets or training data according to variant allocation to prevent interference.
        \item \textit{Geo-based Randomization:} Use geographical separation to minimize interference, assigning treatment and control to different regions.
        \item \textit{Time-based Randomization:} Assign treatment and control at different times to ensure that units do not influence each other simultaneously.
        \item \textit{Network-cluster Randomization:} Randomize clusters of interconnected units to minimize edge cuts and reduce bias.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Edge-Level Analysis}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analyze interactions between units based on their treatment assignment to understand network effects and adjust for biases.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Detecting and Monitoring Interference}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implement robust monitoring systems to detect interference patterns and adjust the experimental design accordingly.
        \item Use ramp phases to gradually introduce treatments and identify potential issues before full deployment.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{23 Measuring Long Term Treatment Effects}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter addresses the challenge of measuring long-term treatment effects in environments where products and services evolve rapidly and are often tested over short cycles. This is crucial as long-term effects can significantly differ from short-term outcomes, influencing strategic decisions and product development.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
Consider the scenario of an online platform introducing a new feature that initially boosts user engagement. Over time, however, as users adapt or the novelty wears off, the engagement might not only return to baseline but potentially decrease if the feature turns out to be less useful or more cumbersome than expected. This discrepancy between immediate and enduring impacts exemplifies why understanding long-term effects is essential.

\subsubsection*{Solutions and Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Long-Running Experiments:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Measure treatment effects at both the start and end of a prolonged period.
        \item Challenges include treatment effect dilution, multiple device usage, cookie churn, and network effects leakage.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Cohort Analysis:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analyze effects on a stable cohort identified by consistent identifiers like user IDs.
        \item Addresses issues like dilution and survivorship bias but may face external validity concerns if the cohort isn't representative.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Post-Period Analysis:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item After the treatment period, compare users previously in treatment and control under uniform conditions.
        \item Useful for isolating learned effects but still subject to dilution and bias.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Time-Staggered Treatments:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Run two versions of the treatment with staggered start times to determine when effects stabilize.
        \item Assumes that the difference between staggered treatments decreases over time.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Holdback and Reverse Experiment:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Maintain a control group even after extending the treatment to the majority, or reintroduce control conditions to treated users after a period.
        \item Balances the need to deploy improvements with the necessity to measure long-term impacts.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{24 References}
\subsubsection*{Problem Statement}
The chapter compiles a vast array of references spanning various aspects of statistics, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. It aims to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding the development and application of statistical methods and experiments in technology and business.

\subsubsection*{Motivating Example}
The references include pivotal studies such as those by Kohavi et al., which delve into the intricacies of online controlled experiments, a cornerstone methodology in modern tech companies like Google, LinkedIn, and Microsoft. These experiments are crucial for making data-driven decisions that enhance user experience and business metrics. For instance, Kohavi's work on controlled experiments helps in understanding how minor changes in a webpage can significantly affect user behavior and business outcomes, thereby guiding the development of more effective web interfaces.
